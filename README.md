# Put Me Down: Vertical Heat Press for Threaded Inserts

## Project Description

Put Me Down is a precision vertical heat press machine designed specifically for inserting threaded inserts into 3D printed parts and other materials. The machine features a balanced counterweight system, adjustable toolhead positioning, and a fixed bottom limit for consistent insert placement.

## Why I Made This Project

I created this project to solve the common problem of manually inserting threaded inserts with inconsistent results. Traditional methods using soldering irons by hand often lead to crooked inserts, inconsistent depth, and damaged parts. This vertical heat press provides precise, repeatable insert placement with proper alignment and depth control.
